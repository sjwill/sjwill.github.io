As a student in the <i>Wisconsin School of Business</i> I am surrounded by dedicated students and world-renowned faculty.

					MARKETING & MANAGEMENT
				</h3>

				<p>
					I'm a fourth year student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I'm double majoring in Marketing and Management in the Wisconsin School of Business. Additionally, I am pursuing a certificate (minor) in Graphic Design through the Art Department. My interests include digital marketing, content creation, developing advertising campaigns, video and photograph editing, and graphic design. I have taken several marketing and graphic design courses at UW that have strengthened my breadth of marketing and design skills.

					GRAPIC DESIGNER @ UW ATHLETICS

				<p>
				"Graphic design is a craft where professionals create visual content to communicate messages. By applying visual hierarchy and page layout techniques, designers use typography and pictures to meet users' specific needs and focus on the logic of displaying elements in interactive designs, to optimize the user experience."

					INTRAMURAL SPORTS
				</h3>

				<p>I get to play alongside my besties, roommates, classmates, and random strangers in a variety of sports and activities throughout the year. I play soccer, volleyball, tennis, and badmitton throughout the school year. This helps balance out the stress of school, work, and everything else I have going on--a release of energy and way to socialize with friends. Plus, league winners receive a coveted champ shirt as well as campus bragging rights.</p>
